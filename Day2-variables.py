# Today is about variables. an example of one is this below
name = 'Kwabena' # For this, the value of the variable is a string. You can store all data types into variables
country = 'Ghana'
age = 250 # This is an integer. Floats can also be stored. Either add a decimal point, or declare it a float by using float(variable_name). variable_name is whatever variable you create.
is_married = False # This is for boolean
skills = ['HTML', 'Linux', 'Python'] # Lists too can be stored in a variable

# There are functions you can use to change the state of the value of the variable. For example int(), float(), and str()
# You can also ask the user to put in a value for your variable using input()
# Other functions to help you when coding are min() which prints out the minimum value (works on numbers and a list of numbers), max() shows the max, len() prints the length of the value
# type() shows data type, list() creates a list and dict() creates a dictionary.

person_info = {
    'name': 'Kwabena',
    'age': 250,
    'country': 'Ghana',
    'city': 'Accra'
}

# You can also create variables in one line. Use commas to separate the variable names and the values.
# An example is this:
# name, country, age, is_married = 'Kwabena', 'Ghana', 250, False
