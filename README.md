# my-30-days-of-Python-journey
I'm learning Python and decided to document my journey here. I'm following another user's repository containing all the materials necessary for learning Python.
He's called Asabeneh. Check out the link below for more info and if you're also interested in learning too.

P.S. I'll be creating 30 Python files to show my progress instead. This is subject to change since I don't know what I will end up doing when I learn new stuff.
